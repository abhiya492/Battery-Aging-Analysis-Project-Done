The Battery Aging Analysis Project aims to explore the degradation characteristics of battery systems through data analysis and visualization. By examining parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, and charge transfer resistance (Rct) over time (in cycles), this project helps identify performance trends and efficiency declines in battery life.
